	we review simple metrological setups, such as quantum metrology with
	spin squeezed states, with Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger states, Dicke
	states and singlet states. We calculate the highest precision achievable
	in these schemes. Then, we present the fundamental notions of quantum
	metrology, such as shot-noise scaling, Heisenberg scaling, the quantum
	Fisher information and the Cramér–Rao bound. Using these, we demonstrate
	that entanglement is needed to surpass the shot-noise scaling in
	very general metrological tasks with a linear interferometer. We
	discuss some applications of the quantum Fisher information, such
	as how it can be used to obtain a criterion for a quantum state to
	be a macroscopic superposition. We show how it is related to the
	speed of a quantum evolution, and how it appears in the theory of
	the quantum Zeno effect. Finally, we explain how uncorrelated noise
	limits the highest achievable precision in very general metrological
	tasks. This article is part of a special issue of Journal of Physics
	A: Mathematical and Theoretical devoted to ‘50 years of Bell’s theorem’.},

  abstract = {Quantum metrology has many important applications in science and technology, ranging from frequency spectroscopy to gravitational wave detection. Quantum mechanics imposes a fundamental limit on measurement precision, called the Heisenberg limit, which can be achieved for noiseless quantum systems, but is not achievable in general for systems subject to noise. Here we study how measurement precision can be enhanced through quantum error correction, a general method for protecting a quantum system from the damaging effects of noise. We find a necessary and sufficient condition for achieving the Heisenberg limit using quantum probes subject to Markovian noise, assuming that noiseless ancilla systems are available, and that fast, accurate quantum processing can be performed. When the sufficient condition is satisfied, a quantum error-correcting code can be constructed that suppresses the noise without obscuring the signal; the optimal code, achieving the best possible precision, can be found by solving a semidefinite program.},

  abstract = {Several quantities of interest in quantum information, including entanglement and purity, are nonlinear functions of the density matrix and cannot, even in principle, correspond to proper quantum observables. Any method aimed to determine the value of these quantities should resort to indirect measurements and thus corresponds to a parameter estimation problem whose solution, i.e. the determination of the most precise estimator, unavoidably involves an optimization procedure. We review local quantum estimation theory and present explicit formulas for the symmetric logarithmic derivative and the quantum Fisher information of relevant families of quantum states. Estimability of a parameter is defined in terms of the quantum signal-to-noise ratio and the number of measurements needed to achieve a given relative error. The connections between the optmization procedure and the geometry of quantum statistical models are discussed. Our analysis allows to quantify quantum noise in the measurements of non observable quantities and provides a tools for the characterization of signals and devices in quantum technology.},

In the further development of the method, the realization that \{DMRG\} operates on a highly interesting class of quantum states, so-called matrix product states (MPS), has allowed a much deeper understanding of the inner structure of the \{DMRG\} method, its further potential and its limitations. In this paper, I want to give a detailed exposition of current \{DMRG\} thinking in the \{MPS\} language in order to make the advisable implementation of the family of \{DMRG\} algorithms in exclusively \{MPS\} terms transparent. I then move on to discuss some directions of potentially fruitful further algorithmic development: while \{DMRG\} is a very mature method by now, I still see potential for further improvements, as exemplified by a number of recently introduced algorithms.},

It leads to an exponential growth of the computational complexity of even most elementary quantum mechanical calculations, not to mention more advanced computational tasks, such as the ones required for studying the metrological potential of quantum states, e.g. computation of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). Solution method: Thanks to the use of the tensor-network formalism, where quantum states are represented as matrix product states and operators as matrix product operators, it is possible to obtain an efficient description where space complexity scales linearly with the number of elementary particles constituting the physical system. Furthermore, it is possible to efficiently optimize QFI over quantum states and operators in those representations, applying the ideas presented in [1]. This allows to study sophisticated quantum metrological models that are beyond the grasp of the standard numerical methods utilizing the full Hilbert space representation of quantum states and operations.

  Abstract                 = {Identification of the optimal quantum metrological protocols in realistic many particle quantum models is in general a challenge that cannot be efficiently addressed by the state-of-the-art numerical and analytical methods. Here we provide a comprehensive framework exploiting matrix product operators (MPO) type tensor networks for quantum metrological problems. The maximal achievable estimation precision as well as the optimal probe states in previously inaccessible regimes can be identified including models with short-range noise correlations. Moreover, the application of infinite MPO (iMPO) techniques allows for a direct and efficient determination of the asymptotic precision in the limit of infinite particle numbers. We illustrate the potential of our framework in terms of an atomic clock stabilization (temporal noise correlation) example as well as magnetic field sensing (spatial noise correlations). As a byproduct, the developed methods may be used to calculate the fidelity susceptibility--a parameter widely used to study phase transitions.},

The approach provides a clear insight into the interplay between decoherence and the extent of prior knowledge in determining the optimal interrogation times and optimal estimation strategies. We propose a general framework capable of describing local oscillator noise as well as additional collective atomic dephasing effects. For a Gaussian noise, the average Bayesian cost can be expressed using the quantum Fisher information. Thus we establish a direct link between the two, often competing, approaches to quantum estimation theory.},

It is shown that the local asymptotic mini-max bound is strictly larger than the Cram{\'e}r-Rao bound in the phase estimation case while both bounds coincide when the minimum mean square error decreases with the order {\$}{\$}{\{}O({\backslash}frac{\{}1{\}}{\{}n{\}}){\}}{\$}{\$}.

We discuss in detail the Holevo Cramér–Rao bound, the quantum local asymptotic normality approach as well as Bayesian methods. Even though the fundamental concepts in the field have been laid out more than forty years ago, a number of important results have appeared much more recently. Moreover, the field drew increased attention recently thanks to advances in practical quantum metrology proposals and implementations that often involve estimation of multiple parameters simultaneously. Since the topics covered in these review are spread in the literature and often served in a very formal mathematical language, one of the main goals of this review is to provide a largely self-contained work that allows the reader to follow most of the derivations and get an intuitive understanding of the interrelations between different concepts using a set of simple yet representative examples involving qubit and Gaussian shift models.},

Still, the presence of decoherence hinders significantly the performance of quantum-enhanced protocols. In this review, we summarize the developments of quantum metrology with particular focus on optical interferometry and derive fundamental bounds on achievable quantum-enhanced precision in optical interferometry taking into account the most relevant decoherence processes including: phase diffusion, losses, and imperfect interferometric visibility. We introduce all the necessary tools of quantum optics as well as quantum estimation theory required to derive the bounds. We also discuss the practical attainability of the bounds derived and stress, in particular, that the techniques of quantum-enhanced interferometry which are being implemented in modern gravitational-wave detectors are close to the optimal ones.}
